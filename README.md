# Life_guidance
Personal demonstration website. 

This is a working site built on Bootstrap. Please note Github doesn't render it properly - possibly because I downloaded bootstrap-related filed locally, instead of adding
a source link in index.html page. The dependency breaks. 

You can download the files and run them on a local server (I used WAMP).
